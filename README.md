## Unsupervised Clustering

Implementation of kmeans and DB-scan:
1. Data scaling + feature selection
2. Parameters selection (k using silhouette and epsilon, min_points using KNN graph and silhouette)
3. Models' training
4. Results comparison including PCA visualisation, DB-scan score and simple counters.

## CTR prediction
Prediction of CTR:
1. EDA
2. Handeling missing values
3. Feature engineering
4. Scaling & Standartization
5. Handeling unbalanced dataset (ADASYN)
6. prediction models: KNN, XGBoost, Random Forest
7. Explainable AI - SHAP

## Monte Carlo
This project is using monte carlo method for prediction of covid 19 trends.

The training data : Israel's new daily cases on 20.1.2022-20.3.2022

Target: Predicting the following 21 days (new daily cases) to the training data
